This repository holds the documentation of a humanoid biped robot that I build for a university assignment. I will open source all files once it is finished. **I'll open source my work in April**

## Specs

* Weight: 1.366 kg
* Height: 54.5 cm
* width: 17.4 cm
* fully 3D printable
* Runs on [ROS (Robot Operating System)](http://www.ros.org/)
* implements ZMP (Zero Moment Point) to maintain its balance while walking

## BOM (Bill Of Materials)

* 12x MG996R servo [Seller](https://www.banggood.com/6X-MG996R-Digital-Metal-Gear-Servo-For-RC-Model-p-1180704.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

## Downloading the 3D files

The 3D files will be available on [Fusion 360 cloud](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/biped-robot-legs) once I finish the project. You can preview the model, but not yet download it.
